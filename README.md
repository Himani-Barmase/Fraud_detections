# Fraud_detections
📌 Overview

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent financial transactions using machine learning techniques. With an imbalanced dataset containing millions of records, the goal is to build a model that accurately distinguishes between fraudulent and legitimate transactions.

The notebook walks through data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

🚀 Features

Data cleaning and preprocessing for large-scale financial data

Handling class imbalance using resampling/SMOTE

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations

Feature engineering for transaction-related patterns

Multiple machine learning models tested (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)

Model evaluation using metrics like Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC

🛠️ Installation & Setup

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/Fraud_detection.git
cd Fraud_detection


Create a virtual environment & install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Open Jupyter Notebook and run:

jupyter notebook Fraud_detection.ipynb

📊 Results

Best performing model: (fill in here, e.g. Random Forest with AUC = 0.98)

Insights: Fraudulent transactions are rare but show distinct patterns in features such as transaction amount, frequency, and time distribution.

📖 Future Improvements

Deploy model as a REST API or web app for real-time fraud detection

Use deep learning techniques (e.g., LSTM, Autoencoders) for sequence-based fraud detection

Improve interpretability with SHAP/feature importance
